- Use Docker container and docker-compose to host postgres and pgadmin
- Use Jupyter notebook when drafting the scripts
- Divide the original data into chunks and load them chunk by chunk
  
# üèóÔ∏èContent Structure Explained

The `script_drafts` folder contains all the contents used when drafting the scripts to insert data. Before working with the Python Notebook, the docker containers configured in the `docker-compose.yaml` should be run:

`docker compose up -d`

If all work has been done, the docker containers should be stopped, by running:

`docker compose stop -d`

[This Stack Overflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46428420/docker-compose-up-down-stop-start-difference) discusses the difference between different `docker compose` commands.
